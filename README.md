# AIMSPICEpy
Python library for decoding .OUT plot files generated by AIM-Spice

NTNU forced me to use AIM-Spice, so I made this script to be able to plot the results in Python.

## Example usage
```py
out_file = Aimspice("example.out")

file_0 = out_file[0]

time = file_0["time"]
voltage = file_0["clock"]

plt.plot(time, voltage)
plt.show()
```
